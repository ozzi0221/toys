        ### What this site is for
        
        * This site is for my students, and currently talks about the following
          toy examples.

          - Simulation of a dynamical system described by a differential
            equation
        
          - SVD (Sinular Value Decomposition) together with a relation
            with PCA (Principal Component Analsys)
          
          - SVD of an image file, which results in some sort of image compression
          
          - Fourier transform (of sound waves), which is an essential concept
            in signals and systems
 
          - Use of OpenAI APIs, which familiarize students with natural
            language models as in ChatGPT.
                  
        ### How this site is written
          
        * All the pages and scripts are written in python using the streamlit
          framework.
    
        #### What TWY does
    
        * TWY teaches engineering mathematics, signals and systems,
          technical writing, etc at Korea University.
        
        * Lecture videos (in Korean)
