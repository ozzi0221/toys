        * This page is for my students, and currently talks about three types
          of toy examples.
        
          - SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) of an image file, which results in
            some sort of image compression
 
          - Simulation of a dynamical system described by a differential
            equation
        
          - Use of OpenAI APIs, which enables students to gain a grasp of how things
            like ChatGPT work.

          updated every now and then.
