        ### What this site is for
        
        * This site is for my students and currently covers the following
          toy examples:

          - Simulation of dynamical systems described by differential
            equations
        
          - SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) and its relation
            to PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
          
          - SVD of an image file, which results in some sort of image compression
          
          - Fourier transform (of sound waves), which is an essential concept
            in signals and systems

          - Classification algorithms as an introduction to machine learning
 
          - Implementation of ChatGPT and DALL¬∑E using their APIs.
                  
        ### How this site is written
          
        * All the pages and scripts are written in python using the Streamlit
          framework.
    
        #### What TWY does
    
        * TWY teaches engineering mathematics, signals and systems,
          technical writing, etc., at Korea University.
        
        * Lecture videos (in Korean)
