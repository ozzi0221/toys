# TWY's TOYs

* This is for my students, and currently talks about three types of toy examples.
        
  - SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) of an image file, which results in
    some sort of image compression

  - Simulation of a dynamical system described by a differential
    equation

  - Use of OpenAI APIs, which enables students to gain a grasp of how natural
    language models as in ChatGPT work.
                            
* All the pages and scripts are written in python using the streamlit
  framework.

* TWY teaches engineering mathematics, signals and systems,
  technical writing, etc at Korea University.

## Usage
```python
streamlit run Home.py
```
