# [TWY's Playground](https://twy80-toys-home-3xaua9.streamlit.app/)

* This is for my students and currently covers the following
  toy examples:
  
  - Simulation of dynamical systems described by differential
    equations

  - SVD (Sinular Value Decomposition) and its relation
    to PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

  - SVD of an image file, which results in some sort of image
    compression

  - Fourier transform (of sound waves), which is an essential
    concept in signals and systems

  - Use of OpenAI APIs, which is added for fun.

* All the pages and scripts are written in python using the
  Streamlit framework.

* TWY teaches engineering mathematics, signals and systems,
  technical writing, etc., at Korea University.

## Usage
```python
streamlit run Home.py
```
