# [TWY's TOYs](https://twy80-toys-home-3xaua9.streamlit.app/)

* This is for my students, and currently talks about the following
  toy examples.
  
  - Simulation of a dynamical system described by a differential
    equation

  - Explanation on SVD (Sinular Value Decomposition) together with a relation
    with PCA (Principal Component Analsys)

  - SVD of an image file, which results in some sort of image compression

  - Use of OpenAI APIs, which enables students to gain a grasp of how natural
    language models as in ChatGPT work.
                            
* All the pages and scripts are written in python using the streamlit
  framework.

* TWY teaches engineering mathematics, signals and systems,
  technical writing, etc at Korea University.

## Usage
```python
streamlit run Home.py
```
