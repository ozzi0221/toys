# [TWY's Playground](https://twy80-toys-home-3xaua9.streamlit.app/)

* This is for my students, and currently talks about the following
  toy examples.
  
  - Simulation of a dynamical system described by a differential
    equation

  - SVD (Sinular Value Decomposition) together with a relation
    with PCA (Principal Component Analsys)

  - SVD of an image file, which results in some sort of image
    compression

  - Fourier transform (of sound waves), which is an essential
    concept in signals and systems

  - Use of OpenAI APIs, which is added here with a hope
    of familiarizing students with natural language models
    as in ChatGPT.

* All the pages and scripts are written in python using the
  streamlit framework.

* TWY teaches engineering mathematics, signals and systems,
  technical writing, etc at Korea University.

## Usage
```python
streamlit run Home.py
```
